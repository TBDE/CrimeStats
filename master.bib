We propose a solution for locating data in decentralized, scientific, data-sharing environments that exploits the small-worlds topology.

We characterize the geometrical properties resulting from the coexistence of a local structure and random long-range connections, and we examine their evolution with size and disorder strength. We show that any finite value of the disorder is able to trigger a ``small-world'' behaviour as soon as the initial lattice is big enough, and study the crossover between a regular lattice and a ``small-world'' one. These results are corroborated by the investigation of an Ising model defined on the network, showing for every finite disorder fraction a crossover from a high-temperature region dominated by the underlying one-dimensional structure to a mean-field like low-temperature region. In particular there exists a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase transition as soon as the disorder strength is finite. [0.5cm\&\#93;",

Independently chosen edges do not result in the statistics (degree distributions, clique multitudes) observed on the Web. Thus, edges in our model are statistically dependent on each other. 2. Our model introduces new vertices in the graph as time evolves. This captures the fact that the Web is changing with time. Our results are two fold: we show that graphs generated using our model exhibit the statistics observed on the Web graph, and additionally, that natural graph models proposed earlier do not exhibit them. This remains true even when these earlier models are generalized to account for the arrival of vertices over time. In particular, the sparse random graphs in our models exhibit properties that do not arise in far denser random graphs generated by Erdos-Renyi models",

	abstract = "Small-world networks are the focus of recent interest because they appear to circumvent many of the limitations of either random networks or regular lattices as frameworks for the study of interaction networks of complex systems. Here, we report an empirical study of the statistical properties of a variety of diverse real-world networks. We present evidence of the occurrence of three classes of small-world networks: (a) scale-free networks, characterized by a vertex connectivity distribution that decays as a power law; (b) broad-scale networks, characterized by a connectivity distribution that has a power-law regime followed by a sharp cut-off; (c) single-scale networks, characterized by a connectivity distribution with a fast decaying tail. Moreover, we note for the classes of broad-scale and single-scale networks that there are constraints limiting the addition of new links. Our results suggestthat the nature of such constraints may be the controlling factor for the emergence of different classes of networks.",

This network reflects the internal structure of the program, and defines the information flow within the program. We show that, (1) due to its growth in time this network displays a scale-free feature in that the probability of the number of links at a node obeys a power-law distribution, and (2) as a result of performance optimization of the program the network has a small-world structure. We believe that these features are generic for large computer programs. Our work extends the previous studies on growing networks, which have mostly been for physical networks, to the domain of computer software."

While the characteristics of small-world networks are now fairly well understood, there is as yet no work on what drives the emergence of such a network architecture. In situations such as neural or transportation networks, where a physical distance between the nodes of the network exists, we study whether the small-world topology arises as a consequence of a tradeoff between maximal connectivity and minimal wiring. Using simulated annealing, we study the properties of a randomly rewired network as the relative tradeoff between wiring and connectivity is varied. When the network seeks to minimize wiring, a regular graph results. At the other extreme, when connectivity is maximized, a near random network is obtained. In the intermediate regime, a small-world network is formed. However, unlike the model of Watts and Strogatz (Nature 393, 440 (1998)), we find an alternate route to small-world behaviour through the formation of hubs, small clusters where one vertex is connected to a large number of neighbours."

A key concept is introduced, the edge multiplicity, that measures the number of triangles passing through an edge. This quantity extends the clustering coefficient in that it involves the properties of two and not just one vertices. The formalism is completed with the definition of a three-vertex correlation function, which is the fundamental quantity describing the properties of clustered networks. The formalism suggests new metrics that are able to thoroughly characterize transitive relations. A rigorous analysis of several real networks, which makes use of the new formalism and the new metrics, is also provided. It is also found that clustered networks can be classified into two main groups: the weak and the strong transitivity classes. In the first class, edge multiplicity is small, with triangles being disjoint. In the second class, edge multiplicity is high and so triangles share many edges. As we shall see in the following paper, the class a network belongs to has strong implications in its percolation properties."

We further explore what they have tried to recover and how the loss influences their subsequent practices. We found that curation of personal digital materials in online stores bears some striking similarities to the curation of similar materials stored locally in that study participants continue to archive personal assets by relying on a combination of benign neglect, sporadic backups, and unsystematic file replication. However, we have also identified issues specific to Internet-based material: how risk is spread by distributing the files among multiple servers and services; the circular reasoning participants use when they discuss the safety of their digital assets; and the types of online material that are particularly vulnerable to loss. The study reveals ways in which expectations of permanence and notification are violated and situations in which benign neglect has far greater consequences for the long-term fate of important digital assets.",

We investigate how dissemination of repository contents can be piggybacked on top of existing email and Usenet traffic. Long-term persistence of the replicated repository may be achieved thanks to current policies and procedures which ensure that email messages and news posts are retrievable for evidentiary and other legal purposes for many years after the creation date. While the preservation issues of migration and emulation are not addressed with this approach, it does provide a simple method of refreshing content with various partners for smaller digital repositories that do not have the administrative resources for more sophisticated solutions."

We also take advantage of the high clustering coefficient of a small-world P2P network and propose an object replication algorithm to handle the heavy object traffic loading situation, e.g. under the dynamic flash crowd scenario. We show that the SWOP network can quickly and efficiently deliver the popular and dynamic object to all requested nodes. Based on our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses how to handle the dynamic flash crowd scenario on a structured P2P network."

These aggregations are susceptible to many of the same preservation challenges that face other web resources. In this paper, we investigate how the aggregations of web resources can be preserved outside of the typical repository environment and instead rely on the thousands of interactive users in the web community and the Web Infrastructure (the collection of web archives, search engines, and personal archiving services) to facilitate preservation. Inspired by Web 2.0 services such as digg, deli.cio.us, and Yahoo! Buzz, we have developed a lightweight system called ReMember that attempts to harness the collective abilities of the web community for preservation purposes instead of solely placing the burden of curatorial responsibilities on a small number of experts.",

While the average shortest path length increases logartihmically as in random networks, the clustering coefficient assumes a large value independent of system size. We derive expressions for the clustering coefficient in two limiting cases: random (C (lnN)2/N) and highly clustered (C = 5/6) scale-free networks. "

It is shown that these graphs are relatively robust. The nonrandom node removal process of targeted attacks is also investigated as a special case of non-uniform site percolation. Critical exponents are calculated by measuring various properties of the distribution of percolation clusters. They are found to be roughly compatible with critical exponents of uniform percolation on these graphs."

Recent studies have analyzed the robustness of the Internet in the face of faults or attacks which may cause node failures. However, the effect of link failure or a series of link failures has not been extensively examined, even though such a situation is more likely to occur in the current Internet environment. In this paper, we propose an attack-and-failure graph model and practical techniques for attacking strategies against nodes, edges or paths in order to reflect real-life attack scenarios. The resiliency of Internet topologies is examined under the attacking strategies, with various metrics including path-failure ratio and ``attack power'', which is defined as the ratio of the failure to attack. The experiments reveal that ``path-based'' attacks can result in greater damage to the connectivity of a network than the other types of attack. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of an attack depends on the objective that the attacker wants to achieve through the attack. The proposed simple but formalized approach can be a springboard for developing more resilient Internet topologies in a variety of aspects."

The other contribution of the paper is an algorithm that calculates multiple spanning trees for input topologies so that at least one tree provides connectivity after a node or a link failure. The algorithm provides minimal number of spanning trees to make input networks fault tolerant."

	abstract = "Recent studies have shown that many real networks follow the power-law distribution of node degrees. Instead of random connectivity, however, power-law connectivity suffers from the vulnerability of targeted attacks, since its interconnection is heavily relying on a very few nodes. In addition, the connectivity of power-law networks becomes more concentrated on the small group of nodes as time goes by, which can be explained by Barabasi and Albert's rich-get-richer model. The rich-get-richer model is known as the most widely accepted generative model and follows the rule of preferential attachment to high-degree nodes. Thus, the preference of high-degree nodes to connect a newly created node renders the network less resilient as evolves. In this paper, we propose three different evolving strategies which can be applicable to the Internet topologies and the resiliency of evolving networks are measured by two resiliency metrics. From the experiments, we show that choosing an appropriate evolving strategy is more effective to increase the resiliency of network topology, rather than simply adding more links. Also, we show the possibility of improving the attack resiliency of Internet topology by adapting only a part of networks, e.g. 20 40\%, to a new evolving strategy, such as change from the maxdegree preference to the average-degree preference, which can be considered as a practical range of deployment."

However, P2P streaming is vulnerable to node failures and malicious attacks because of its high bandwidth demand and stringent timing requirement. In this paper, we investigated several heuristics to improve an overlay's resilience to failures and attacks. We formalized the overlay connectivity resilience as a graph theoretic problem and proved that disjoint paths with variable lengths are e ective in increasing overlays' connectivity resilience. We proposed a distributed heuristic called MPath that enables each peer to improve its connectivity without global knowledge or coordination. We designed the MPath heuristic to work in conjunction with existing overlay improvement mechanisms. Such integration not only speeds up overlay convergence, but also signi cantly cuts down MPath's maintenance overhead. Our experiments showed that MPath reduced the number of disconnected components in an overlay by an order of magnitude when 20\% of overlay nodes failed."

	abstract = "The growth of peer-to-peer applications on the Internet motivates interest in general purpose overlay networks. The construction of overlays connecting a large population of transient nodes poses several challenges. First, connections in the overlay should reflect the underlying network topology, in order to avoid overloading the network and to allow good application performance. Second, connectivity among active nodes of the overlay should be maintained, even in the presence of high failure rates or when a large proportion of nodes is not active. Finally, the cost of using the overlay should be spread evenly among peer nodes for fairness reasons as well as for the sake of application performance. To preserve scalability, we seek solutions to these issues that can be implemented in a fully decentralized manner and rely only on local knowledge from each node. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called the localiser which addresses these three key challenges. The localiser refines the overlay in a way that reflects geographic locality so as to reduce network load. Simultaneously, it helps to evenly balance the number of neighbours of each node in the overlay, thereby sharing the load evenly as well as improving the resilience to random node failures or disconnections. The proposed algorithm is presented and evaluated in the context of an unstructured peer-to-peer overlay network produced using the Scamp protocol. We provide a theoretical analysis of the various aspects of the algorithm. Simulation results based on a realistic network topology model confirm the analysis and demonstrate the localiser efficiency."

Algebraic connectivity of a graph is the second smallest eigenvalue of its Laplacian matrix and a measure of speed of solving consensus problems in networks. We demonstrate that it is possible to dramatically increase the algebraic connectivity of a regular complex network by 1000 times or more without adding new links or nodes to the network. This implies that a consensus problem can be solved incredibly fast on certain small-world networks giving rise to a network design algorithm for ultrafast information networks. Our study relies on a procedure called random rewiring due to Watts \& Strogatz (Nature, 1998). Extensive numerical results are provided to support our claims and conjectures. We prove that the mean of the bulk Laplacian spectrum of a complex network remains invariant under random rewiring. The same property only asymptotically holds for scale-free networks. A relationship between increasing the algebraic connectivity of complex networks and robustness to link and node failures is also shown. This is an alternative approach to the use of percolation theory for analysis of network robustness. We also show some connections between our conjectures and certain open problems in the theory of random matrices."

We fin a critical traffic load above which the probability of massive traffic congestions destroying the network communication capabilities is finite."

The concept of vulnerability helps to measure the response of complex networks subjected to attacks on vertices and edges and it allows to spot the critical component of a network in order to improve its security. We introduce an accurate and computable definition of network vulnerability which is directly connected with its topology and we analyze its basic properties. We discuss the relationship of the vulnerability with other parameters of the network and we illustrate this with some examples."

In particular, scale-free networks (i.e. networks with power-law degree distribution) seem much more robust than random networks in case of failures, while they are more sensitive to attacks. In this paper we deepen the study of the differences in the behavior of these two kinds of networks when facing failures or attacks. We moderate the general affirmation that scale-free networks are much more sensitive than random networks to attacks by showing that the number of links to remove in both cases is similar, and by showing that a slightly modified scenario for failures gives results similar to the ones for attacks. We also propose and analyze an efficient attack strategy against links."

Selection for better efficiency leads to the well-known star topology, while selection for robustness only results in a relatively dense core and a small periphery. Concomitant selection for both efficiency and robustness leads to networks with intermittent center/periphery values. Networks evolving under multiple attack regimes develop distinct topologies with larger cores, and are characterized by parameter distributions different from those developing under single-attack regimes."

Following the failure of a component, the excess load arising is equally shared among the neighbor components still in operation. The effect of the topology on the failure cascading propagation is investigated by considering both small-world and scale-free networks. The cascading dynamics due to intentional attacks on individual nodes is also investigated by means of a simplified capacity-load model."

The index is derived from the quotient of the relative graph density and the percentage of zero entries in the adjacency matrix. The numerical values for the compactness index are reported for miscellaneous graphs, including several families of structurally related graphs."

Closely related methods have been used in other disciplines for quite some time. We propose a visualization method that supports the simultaneous exploration of a link structure and a ranking of its nodes by showing the result of the ranking algorithm in one dimension and using graph drawing techniques in the remaining one or two dimensions to show the underlying structure. We suggest to use a simple spectral layout algorithm, because it does not add to the complexity of an implementation already used for ranking, but nevertheless produces meaningful layouts. The effectiveness of our visualizations is demonstrated with example applications, in which they provide valuable insight into the link structure and the ranking mechanism alike. We consider them useful for the analysis of query results, maintenance of search engines, and evaluation of Web graph models."

In this paper, we focus on detecting critical nodes, or nodes whose deletion results in the minimum pair-wise connectivity among the remaining nodes. This problem, known as the CRITICAL NODE PROBLEM has applications in several fields including biomedicine, telecommunications, and military strategic planning. We show that the recognition version of the problem is N P -complete and derive a mathematical formulation based on integer linear programming. In addition, we propose a heuristic for the problem which exploits the combinatorial structure of the graph. The heuristic is then enhanced by the application of a local improvement method. A computational study is presented in which we apply the integer programming formulation and the heuristic to real and randomly generated data sets. For all instances tested, the heuristic is able to efficiently provide optimal solutions in a fraction of the time required by a commercial software package."

	abstract = "Centrality measures, or at least our interpretations of these measures, make implicit assumptions about the manner in which things flow through a network. For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation, namely, the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics, paths, trails or walks), and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of flows they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow processes they get the wrong answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how things flow."

This paper investigates how big the failure probability can be, before the capability to efficiently find a path in the network is lost. Our main results show tight upper and lower bounds for the failure probability which permits routing, both for the hypercube and for the d−dimensional mesh. We use tools from percolation theory to show that in the d−dimensional mesh, once a giant component appears — efficient routing is possible. A different behavior is observed when the hypercube is considered. In the hypercube there is a range of failure probabilities in which short paths exist with high probability, yet finding them must involve querying essentially the entire network. Thus the routing complexity of the hypercube shows an asymptotic phase transition. The critical probability with respect to routing complexity lies in a different location then that of the critical probability with respect to connectivity. Finally we show that an oracle access to links (as opposed to local routing) may reduce significantly the complexity of the routing problem. We demonstrate this fact by providing tight upper and lower bounds for the complexity of routing in the random graph Gn,p.."

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature is found to be a consequence of the two generic mechanisms that networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and new vertices attach preferentially to already well connected sites. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scalefree distributions, indicating that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.

This result was quite unexpected in the networking community and stirred significant interest in exploring the possible causes of this phenomenon. The work of Barabasi and Albert [2] and its application to network topology generation in the work of Medina et al. [3] have explored a promising class of models that yield strict power-law vertex degree distributions. In this paper, we re-examine the BGP measurements that form the basis for the results reported in [1]. We find that by their very nature (i.e., being strictly BGP-based), the data provides a very incomplete picture of Internet connectivity at the AS level. The AS connectivity maps constructed from this data (the original maps) typically miss 20 -- 50\% or even more of the physical links in AS maps constructed using additional sources (the extended maps). Subsequently, we find that while the vertex degree distributions resulting from the extended maps are heavy-tailed, they deviate significantly from a strict power law. Finally, we show that available historical data does not support the connectivity-based dynamics assumed in [2]. Together, our results suggest that the Internet topology at the AS level may well have developed over time following a very different set of growth processes than those proposed in [2]."

For a few places we have records going back several years that exhibit this regular rate of growth. Even when there are no obvious bottlenecks, traffic tends not to grow much faster. This reflects complicated interactions of technology, economics, and sociology, similar to, but more delicate than those that have produced Moores Law in semiconductors. A doubling of traffic each year represents extremely fast growth, much faster than the increases in other communication services. If it continues, data traffic will surpass voice traffic around the year 2002. However, this rate of growth is slower than the frequently heard claims of a doubling of traffic every three or four months. Such spectacular growth rates apparently did prevail over a two-year period 1995-6. Ever since, though, growth appears to have reverted to the Internets historical pattern of a single doubling each year. Progress in transmission technology appears sufficient to double network capacity each year for about the next decade. However, traffic growth faster than a tripling each year could probably not be sustained for more than a few years. Since computing and storage capacities will also be growing, as predicted by the versions of Moores Law appropriate for those technologies, we can expect demand for data transmission to continue increasing. A doubling in Internet traffic each year appears a likely outcome. If Internet traffic continues to double each year, we will have yet another form of Moores Law. Such a growth rate would have several important implications. In the intermediate run, there would be neither a clear bandwidth glut nor a bandwidth scarcity, but a more balanced situation, with supply and demand growing at comparable rates. Also, computer and network architectures would be strongly affected, since most data would stay local. Programs such as Napster would play an increasingly important role. Transmission would likely continue to be dominated by file transfers, not by real time streaming media."

Graph theoretic, simulation, and optimization-based techniques have played a significant role in examining potential network vulnerabilities given the insights they can provide for mitigating facility loss and prioritizing fortification efforts. Central to these approaches is the concept of facility (arc--node) importance or criticality to system survivability. Assessments of network vulnerability can dramatically differ based on how facility importance is characterized. In this review, various approaches for assessing facility importance and network vulnerability are examined. The key differences in these approaches are the ways in which a facility’s role in maintaining network operability is evaluated given arc--node disruption. Comparative results suggest significant differences exist among measures of facility importance and network performance. Furthermore, the subsequent incongruities in these measures and their implications need to be clearly understood to support interdiction risk and vulnerability assessment for critical infrastructures."

In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the worldwide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph."

In this context, Newman and Girvan [9] recently proposed an objective function for graph clustering called the Q function which allows automatic selection of the number of clusters. Empirically, higher values of the Q function have been shown to correlate well with good graph clusterings. In this paper we show how optimizing the Q function can be reformulated as a spectral relaxation problem and propose two new spectral clustering algorithms that seek to maximize Q. Experimental results indicate that the new algorithms are efficient and effective at finding both good clusterings and the appropriate number of clusters across a variety of real-world graph data sets. In addition, the spectral algorithms are much faster for large sparse graphs, scaling roughly linearly with the number of nodes n in the graph, compared to O(n^2) for previous clustering algorithms using the Q function."

Graph’s robustness is quantified with the node and the link connectivity, two topological metrics that give the number of nodes and links that have to be removed in order to disconnect a graph. The algebraic connectivity, i.e. the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, is a spectral property of a graph, which is an important parameter in the analysis of various robustness-related problems. In this paper we study the relationship between the proposed metrics in three well-known complex network models: the random graph of Erd˝os-R{\'e}nyi, the small-world graph of Watts-Strogatz and the scale-free graph of Barab{\'a}si-Albert. From [11] it is known that the algebraic connectivity is a lower bound on both the node and the link connectivity. Through extensive simulations with the three complex network models, we show that the algebraic connectivity is not trivially connected to graph’s robustness to node and link failures. Furthermore, we show that the tightness of this lower bound is very dependent on the considered complex network model."

In the civilian sphere, the threat is from terrorist attacks, while in the military sphere this comes from the increasing tendency to view communications networks as high-value targets. This combination of factors makes it important to study the robustness of network topologies. The obvious measures of network robustness are the graph-theoretic concepts of node and link connectivity, and we argue that node connectivity is the best of these. We have developed a network analysis, design, and simulation package, called CAVALIER. We use the agent-based combat simulation feature of CAVALIER to explore the impact on performance of 300 randomly generated network topologies. Simulation results show that node connectivity correlates positively with performance, and is a better predictor of performance than other measures of network robustness. Furthermore, node connectivity provides the best complement to a previously developed measure of network efficiency (the intelligence coefficient). Together the two measures provide an excellent way of assessing network quality. We therefore have two perspectives on reality: our agent-based simulation, and the mathematics of graph theory, which provide the same answer, and therefore give greater assurance that node connectivity is indeed the best measure of network robustness in the face of potential node destruction."

Although design methods have been proposed for creating, ab initio, a network that has optimal robustness according to a given measure, one is often instead faced with an existing network that cannot feasibly be substantially modified or redesigned, yet whose robustness can be improved by a lesser degree of modification.We present empirical results that show how robustness, as measured either by the size of the largest connected component or by the shortest path length between pairs of nodes, is affected by several different strategies that alter the network by rewiring a fraction of the edges or by adding new edges. We find that a modest alteration of an initially ‘scale-free’ network can usefully improve robustness against attack, particularly when the fraction of attacked nodes is small, and we identify modification schemes that are most effective for this purpose."

We consider and compare the results for two di/erent networktopologies: the Erd1os.R2enyi random graph and the Barab2asi.Albert scale-free network. We also discuss brie5y a dynamical model recently proposed to take into account the dynamical redistribution of loads after the initial damage of a single node of the network."
